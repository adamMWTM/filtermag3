After years working closely with Maxime Le Guil as an assistant and engineer, he is now responsible for the maintenance of the studio. Dumelz has worked on all aspects of the creation of Rue Boyer, helping WSDG and Symphonic Acoustics, and then taking it from where they left off, dealing with wiring, installing gear, the Atmos system, and more.
                                            </p>

                                                “The first thing you need to know is that Studio A can do everything,” says Dumelz. “It does Atmos, it does full analogue with an SSL desk and a tape machine, it works fully digital (i.e. in the box), and it can work as a live room when the console goes below ground. We were designing a room that is essentially three rooms in one.”

                                                “I had to find the best solutions to ensure that everything works together. We really tried to maximize the technical specifications of the studio in a creative way. I selected the gear, computers, converters, and so on. There is a lot of gear out there and we had to find the right pieces for the puzzle. Once everything arrived, it had to be assembled and installed.”

                                                “The very first shifts when we fitted the cables happened in late November 2021. For a long time it seemed like all I was talking about was cables! (laughs) The process was drawn out because some of the orders for cables were delayed. It is not easy to get Mogami cables in general, and the global situation at the time made it even more difficult. Even regular XLR connectors were out of stock everywhere.”

All audio cables go through these tunnels: RJ45s, coaxial cables, and so on. It is a pain, but we have guide cables to help. It is hard work!”

                                                “We had to make the cables by hand to meet our requirements so we did all the soldering, connectors, everything. I think we purchased more than a kilometre of cable just for the microphone XLRs! We bought around 800m of multi-channel cable, 500m of speaker cable and 500m of RJ and coaxial cable. We also had multicore cables, like 24-channel, 16-channel, 8-channel multicores. The MADI system runs on coaxial cable that we made to fit the studio. We built AES3 digital cables, which are similar to microphone cables but with a fixed impedance.”

                                                “We designed our own XLR microphone panels, and embedded plenty of them around the entire ground floor, so when people plug things in it is very fast and there aren’t piles of cables on the floor, which means that the walkways are always clear. It really makes a difference for the artists and for the engineers. We even managed to save on cables, because we knew that we wanted to keep the computers in the control room, so they are accessible at all times. We find it frustrating when the computers are located far away in the machine room.”

The storage unit is situated inside the control room at the bottom of one of our outboard racks. It makes it much easier to do simple tasks like plugging in a hard drive or using a wireless keyboard and mouse, or even using AirDrop! Keeping the tape machines inside the studio also meant that we didn’t have to build a large external machine room.”

                                                “To make all of this happen, it was essential to stay organized, and we had a great team, that included Oswaldo Terrones, who soldered almost everything, and Thomas Lefebvre, who is like a Swiss Army knife and  can do almost everything in a recording studio. Before any of this took place we also had to create all the designs and plans. This was the most important part of my job. I made piles of documents! I designed all of the audio, RJ45 and BNC patch bays on paper, and the mic panels too. I also made the wiring plans and patch lists.”

                                                “Each room has two patch bays. Both consoles have on-board patch bays but they have some limitations. The SSL patch bay was too small, and we needed something bigger. So I made an extension bay on the wall. It would have been nice to move the entire patch bay outside of the console, but this would have taken an entire month of extra work because there are so many cables."

                                                “As we are using a different type of patch bay in the wall, it meant that I could install some digital lines, which was a useful bonus. In Studio B we had another issue. The desk is an old API 2488 from the 70’s, and Maxime did not want to touch the internal patch bay. He wanted to keep it true to the original. So we reproduced the in-board patch of the API in the wall, which meant that we didn't have to alter the wiring at all.”

The patch bay in the wall is for monitoring, digital lines and headphone amps. Old school guys who work on the console might want to use the monitoring of the desk. But we also have Atmos to consider, as well as an in-the-box workflow. To manage this, I wanted to be able to access all of my monitoring options from one patch bay.”

I can patch the talkback into the MTRX, so I can manage my headphone cues digitally. Or I can choose to do it the old school way with the console sends. All of my speakers are on that patch bay too, so I can make changes if needed. By contrast, in Studio B the external patch bay is the main patch.”

The MTRX works great for that because it can deal with Dante and MADI. It was an obvious choice. It also allows us to control many outputs, which helps with 7.1.4. Most of the controllers on the market only allow you to control 6-8 speakers."

We had to ensure that we had all the appropriate cards for conversion and DSP processing, as well as the MADI and Dante cards, and that we had enough channel capacity to handle both basic mixing and tracking, and the more modern digital workflows for Atmos. We don’t use the MTRX to record, but it is very useful for monitor control, calibration and for when we work in Atmos.”

We have three subs in the room, and two more subs in front of the desk. You have to set many filters and delays to calibrate all of them. When it comes to recording and mixing, we have three Avid HDIO converters, and also a Lavry Gold. We use these for A/D when recording, or for D/A when you want to mix on the console.”

To work in Atmos at a high level you need a separate rendering machine, which we put in a small booth next to the control room. That means you have to find a way to send 128 audio channels from the mix room to the rendering room, via MADI or Dante. These requirements inform more than just the wiring, they inform the converters, the HDX cards, the computer specifications… everything.”

We actually had a lot of support from Dolby, and we also got a lot of advice from some masters, like Alan Meyerson. Studio B is what we call ‘Atmos-ready’, but we haven’t fully installed the system. We are not sure if we need it to be an Atmos studio yet, but the wiring is in place if we decide to go ahead with it. The design is future-proof!”
