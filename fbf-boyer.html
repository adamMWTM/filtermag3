                                                                When the request came in at the end of 2020 for Storyk and WSDG to build a studio for Mix With The Masters in Paris, it was in the first instance regarded as business as usual. However, Storyk very quickly realized that the project was anything but, and this was not even taking the issue into account of constructing a studio during a pandemic, not to mention from the other side of the Atlantic.

In 1969, Eddie changed my life when he invited me to design Jimi Hendrix’s studio in New York, Electric Lady Studios. Eddie became a life-long friend, and we’ve done many projects together. When Eddie calls, I take his suggestions very seriously. Because of MWTM’s significance, the project had caught my attention in any case, and I expected it to become an important facility in our industry.”

First of all, it was not only to be a world-class studio, but also an instructional and teaching studio. On top, it needs to serve as a backdrop for their famous instructional videos—basically the studio also needs to be a film set! The functionality of the studio is really complicated. Most studios are not set up to do all this.”

Wood and curtains and a seventies look. I’ve been involved in thousands of studios, with lots of different clients, and this was a strange request, that I never had before.”

However, it turns out that their vision came into focus over a long period of time, as a rather unexpected side-effect of the professional needs of Maxime.

At one point I worked in the old Plus 30 Studios in Paris, then I was in the US, and when I came back to Paris I built a home studio, which was great. After that I moved to another building, and I started to feel a real need for stability for me as a mixer. So my initial idea was to buy a place that I could convert into a studio.”

When we shoot videos in New York or Los Angeles, or other places, we tend to move around with a local team, and the first problem is simply scheduling, which takes away some of the magic of the in-the-moment story-telling.”

Sometimes the geometry of the room is awkward, sometimes it’s the lighting, or the colour of the fabric. The fabrics can look really nice in real life, with nice beige, white or grey textures, but they are very difficult to capture well on camera.”

                                                                Once Maxime and Victor recognised that they had a unique opportunity to create a studio from scratch that is also a perfect filming location, they decided that it made sense to make it suitable for other purposes as well.

                                                                “It was about creating opportunities,” says Victor. “Of course, the studio would first and foremost need to work as a top studio, where leading studio professionals are entirely comfortable. But we also wanted a multi-purpose space. Being able to film in the studio was an  obvious additional purpose, as was the fact that it needs to be a learning space. Plus we reckoned that it could be a place for people to connect and socialise. We envisioned a space that could also work as a hang!”

                                                                “Finding the right layout for the building and the studio took quite a bit of time,” adds Maxime. “We actually ended up modifying the structure of the building a lot. Because the MWTM section also involved video and audio editing rooms, we built a third floor, and for the ‘hang’ aspect, a terrace at the top of the building. All this took forever, because we’re in the middle of Paris, and you need to get building permits and deal with neighbours, associations, and things like that. We had to convince everybody around us! And of course, construction always takes longer than you think.”

                                                                The vision for the 120m2 ground floor had by now extended to something completely different than a straightforward mixing space for Maxime. However, the original idea was not abandoned, as he explains. “We knew we needed to have a studio A and a studio B, which do not touch, so work can be done on entirely different projects at the same time. The idea was to have two separate working studios, so if one studio is busy, I can use the other.”

                                                                “We also always knew there would be one smaller studio space, in a room that cannot be modified, because it has bearing walls that cannot be torn down. That room would be Studio B. The real challenge was what to do with Studio A: before soundproofing we had 100m2 to work with, which works out as roughly 85m2 of useable space. The problem was that this is not enough to have a big control room <i>and</i> a big live room.”

By the end of 2020, the Mix With The Masters team realised that their studio project had become so demanding that it was time to engage the very top people in the world. Eddie Kramer suggested John Storyk and the Walters-Storyk Design Group.

Despite hopes to the contrary, the pandemic would remain in full force for another year. With Storyk stuck on the American East Coast, this greatly affected the project, as he recalled…

On the positive, we discovered that we could do it.”

WSDG currently has offices and representations in the US, Latin America, Asia, and Europe, with approximately 60 people working for the group. In Europe, the company has a presence in Barcelona, Berlin, and Basel, and particularly the latter office, run by Dutchman Dirk Noy, proved invaluable.

This made it much easier to provide the much-needed construction supervision. All the design and documentation work took place in the New York office, with lead architect and senior partner Romina Larregina as our project manager. We’ve done projects in the Middle East, China and South America in similar fashion. So when the covid era arrived and everybody had to stay at home and use Zoom, we were already fully set up to work like this.”

We’ve also always been an international operation, and at the forefront of remote collaborations for 10 or 15 year. Skype was a revolution! When covid came along, we said, ‘OK, let’s just activate two more Zoom accounts.’ However, the pandemic did complicate a number of things, because there are key moments in a project’s life when you have to be on site.”

                                                                “The initial phase is critical, as it involves assessing the site. Are the wall systems in good condition? What are the existing conditions and dimensions? What are the issues concerning acoustic decoupling and sound isolation? We used very experienced builders from Vienna, because we had worked with them before, and they knew what we wanted. They’re extremely familiar with our detailing and expectations.

I went to Paris probably 10 times in total. Because of the pandemic, there were times when this was really complicated, with us having to work our way around lockdowns and quarantine requirements, and so on. For one journey from Basel to Paris I was literally the only passenger on the train!”

This project took longer than anticipated, because we had problems sourcing some of the basic materials. For example, it sounds ridiculous, but at one point we had a really hard time getting a particular type of wooden planks. It meant having a near-constant struggle with the project timeline.”

It’s the smart way to build a studio. In the case of this studio, the acoustic materials were manufactured to our specifications by a company in the UK called RPG. The materials were then shipped to Vienna, where they were reconfigured, and from there brought to Paris and installed by our Vienna builders, Hutter Acustix.”

There are many elements hidden behind the surfaces of the finished studio. All the fabrics at the back are covering low-frequency treatments, like perforated plates of wood with very specific holes in them. It’s not easy to install those without destroying the acoustic effect they are designed to have. You need to have done this before, which again is why we used the team from Vienna.”

                                                                “Another challenge was that we wanted the HVAC [heating, ventilation, air-conditioning] systems to be as invisible as possible. This meant that the prefabricated wooden panels did not only have to conform to the desired retro look, but they also needed to have dual acoustic and HVAC functionality. There also were some existing HVAC subsystems that we had to integrate and make as invisible as possible. Plus we designed invisible routing for the cables, and hid several subwoofers. There were the Atmos speakers, and the lighting system to deal with as well. We had to fit many pieces of a complicated puzzle together.”

                                                                When running seminars at La Fabrique in the south of France, MWTM always makes good use of the enormous control room and large live spaces at the studio. Clearly, given the restricted space at the Paris location, the assumption was that it was physically impossible to build a large control room <i>and</i> a large live room there, particularly with significant space taken up by a large desk. However, MWTM and WSDG managed to square this circle, using a completely novel approach.

In today’s in-the-box environment, it means that many of these live rooms are seldom used, and have been turned into lounges filled with big sofas. At the same time, in the studios in the US where we did one-day seminars the control rooms were always too small.”

Even though the participants may not be using desks themselves in their own work, when they see things done on a desk it makes the recording and mixing process come much more alive.”

So we felt that it’s essential to have desks in both studios. We also did not want one of these hybrid consoles, likely the SSL Duality or the new Neve Genesys, that try to replicate the workflow of an old desk, but at the same time be modern. If we went vintage, we wanted to go full vintage.”

For the main room we decided on a 48-channel E-series SSL 4000, which came from London, and was restored to optimal condition by French engineer Gil Martini. The 4000 is easier to maintain than a 9000, and we like the E-series for cosmetic reasons, because it’s black.”

                                                                “We had the idea of making the desk disappear underneath the floor, using an elevator,” explained Le Guil, “Like Batman! To do this, we had to dig a hole underneath the floor the size of the desk, as if installing a swimming pool. We dug into the foundation, reinforced the hole with concrete, made it waterproof, installed an elevator, placed the desk on it, so it can go down, and made it possible to close the floor above it. It means we can turn the control room into a live room, with  Studio B as the control room for Studio A.”

While John Storyk and WSDG were initially rather worried about the disappearing desk, they managed to turn it to their advantage.

So we had perforations made in the wooden floor panel that the desk rests on, which becomes an absorber.”

It means that the floor underneath the desk is an asset for us with respect to low frequency control. And when the desk is down, we made the cover that goes over it reflective, which helps when the room is used as a live space.”

                                                                The way Storyk and WSDG handled the disappearing desk situation touched on the principal and most difficult aspect of building a recording studio: acoustic design. Amazingly, until not so long ago, there were very few ways to predict a room’s acoustic behaviour. It wasn’t until the nineties that tools were developed that can reliably predict acoustic behaviour above the Schroeder frequency, roughly 200-300Hz.

WSDG has developed pioneering software called NIRO that can predict the behaviour of low end in a room, and Rue Boyer is one of the first studio designs in which it was applied. Storyk elaborates on NIRO and how it was applied at Rue Boyer <a href="niro.html" target="_blank">elsewhere in this issue</a>.

But the quest for excellence and innovation by the team that built the studio did not stop there, as Maxime Le Guil explained.

We really tried our best to leave nothing to chance. We also did a lot of research into how the big studios around the world solved a variety of issues, and you can say that our new studio is a synthesis of all the knowledge that we gathered.”

But many of the masters on our roster shared their expertise and knowledge, and we talked to the chief tech engineer of Capital Studios in LA, and in Paris we talked to Gang Recording Studio, Motorbass Studio, and what used to be known as Plus 30 Studios.”

We also built our own cool XLR panel, and so on. We researched every brand of cable, and questioned the choice of every single wire.

Rue Boyer Studio A’s main monitors were designed and fabricated by <a href="speakers.html" target="_blank">PK Pandey</a> and his company Symphony Acoustics, under license of George Augspurger. Storyk explained how the monitors were fitted into the MWTM studio.

The main issue was to make sure that their acoustical centers are at ear level.”

They were all above a big piece of glass, and speakers that are in the wrong position will rarely sound good. After many years of wondering why this was the case, our industry finally determined it was the reflections off the console that caused a time domain anomaly that of course would translate into the frequency domain.”

It’s a solution I love, but it would have not worked here. Instead we placed the monitors at ear-level on the sides of the glass, in angled frames. In that position, the monitors can behave the way they’re supposed to behave. We also installed several additional subs, which are part of the same system as the mains and are purely there to provide a smoother low end throughout the control room. We think of the additional subs along with the Augs mids and highs as one monitoring system.”

                                                                “We put a processor in the system so we can time-align all of the monitor components, as well as introduce minor EQ, as required. Because we’re always putting mains at ear level, you’re seeing more and more engineers working with them. Engineers will always work with near-field and mid-field monitors as well, but what’s the point of going through all the work of fitting mains in a tracking control room if you don’t trust them? And to be able to trust them they need to be at ear-level, and well-calibrated.”

The look and feel of the studio and equipment has been thoughtfully considered. The same can be said of other spaces in the studio, including the large lounge, with a big sofa and a full glass roof.

When somebody like Jimmy Douglas, or Eddie Kramer, or any of the engineers associated with MWTM, walks in, they’re immediately in an environment that they are comfortable and familiar with. That’s the whole point. They need to be able to go to work quickly, and they need to teach. Whereas if we create a commercial studio, or a studio specifically for one person, the requirements might be very different.”

It made Storyk distinctly nervous.

                                                                “I was saying to myself, ‘before they open, I’m sure they’ll try it out, and invite in a few friends to do the same, and we’ll do some tuning that way.' But instead, they invited Jack in. In my view, it’s not a smart move to invite a top producer into a room that’s not even been tested yet. It’s not how I would have started using the studio! I would have walked into the shallow end of the pool first. But, as I learned during this adventure, Victor and Maxime do not have a shallow end in their pool. It’s all deep!” [laughs]

My answer is always, ‘my favourite studio is the one I am working on right now,’ and I stick to that answer. However, having experienced Rue Boyer myself now for a few hours, I’d say the studio is perfect. I fully expect the Paris street department to soon put some white stripes on the crosswalk in front of the studio building!”

                                                                While referencing one of the most famous studios in the world, John Storyk was talking in Rue Boyer Studio A, under the movie-shooting spotlights. It was the afternoon of the very first day that he was able to visit the studio in person. Even for a seasoned professional like him, the experience was momentous. “It was amazing to enter the studio! 52 years later I still have that nervous feeling: ‘is it going to translate?’ ‘Will the acoustics work?’ ‘Is the finished, completed space as I had envisioned it?’

                                                                Clearly, despite significant progress in studio design and the science of acoustics and its application, there is still an art to making studios, and an element of unpredictability. It’s a challenge that Storyk relishes, “I don’t want to ever lose sight of the artistic part of designing studios! If the intuitive artistic part of this process disappears, I’m out. But I don’t think it ever will.”

We’re at the heart of the 20th arrondissement, which is less touristic than the rest of Paris, but has lots of cool restaurants and cafés and an artist community.”

The retro seventies aesthetic of Rue Boyer, that led to head-scratching on the part of Storyk, is apparent in the abundance of wood and brown colours, but feels elegant and cozy, rather than old-fashioned.

                                                                “The studio is meant for in-house use by people connected to MWTM,” concludes Maxime. “We’ve already done one-day seminars and film shoots in in the studio, and it can be rented by the masters on our roster and the wider MWTM community. It’s a family and friends situation.”
