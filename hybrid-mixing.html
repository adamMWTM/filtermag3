                                                he central components of any hybrid setup are the converters and the analog summing mixers. These essential pieces of equipment not only impart a unique color onto the sounds that pass through them, but they can reshape your workflow significantly as well. Some engineers opt to sum their mixes in the box and send the stereo bus out for a little analog warmth. Other engineers choose to sum in the analog domain, adding some additional DSP processing afterwards. Some even go all the way, using a complex network of hardware inserts, summing mixers, tape machines and plugins to bring the final mix together. All of these processes are equally valid, but each one yields a unique sonic result.
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                While good quality converters are universally agreed to be essential to any studio, the summing box is a little more contentious. The popularization of dedicated summing mixers can be traced back to the early stages of digital recording. By the mid 2000s, almost all commercial studios had transitioned to using digital audio workstations, and plugins had become an essential part of modern music production. But many engineers had a hard time adapting to mixing in the box. They felt that internal DSP summing created mixes that sounded inferior to those done on a console. Equipment manufacturers started producing rack-mountable summing mixers to meet this new demand, and to bridge the gap between the analog and digital worlds.

                                                Almost two decades later, the landscape has changed significantly. The headroom of digital audio workstations has expanded, and the sound quality of plugins has developed significantly. These days it would take a well-trained ear to reliably tell the difference between digital and analog summing in terms of fidelity. In the hands of the right engineer, both tools can yield phenomenal results. In fact, computers have become so powerful that software developers have begun to emulate the sound of classic summing mixers such as Neve and API. We are rapidly heading towards a world where high-fidelity audio is easily accessible, but where character, tone and creativity are what drive the culture forward. Adopting a hybrid mixing workflow can still give an edge in this regard. Research indicates that using physical tools can foster more creative thinking, and the unique tones that these tools offer can give your mixes an original sound and quality that is difficult to match.

                                                Designing your own hybrid mixing set-up is like solving a puzzle; it takes time to find the right pieces that fit your workflow. We reached out to five award-winning mixers to get an inside look at their hybrid mixing set-ups, in order to learn more about what tools they are using and how they all interact.

                                                SM’s workflow is best described as efficient and open-minded. His ProTools template has been carefully designed and routed to create both digital and analog-summed mixes in real-time. Both of these signal paths have been calibrated and gain-matched, allowing him to A/B the two mixes seamlessly.

                                            <p>
                                                When A/B-ing, MSM uses plugin emulations of his hardware to match the signal chains as closely as possible. If he uses the Curve Bender on the mix bus, he will insert the equivalent emulation by Brainworx and ensure that their parameters match. This enables him to make much more objective choices.

Sometimes when I go analog, it just doesn’t work. Something gets a bit too soft. Something happens to the transients and the energy is gone. I could go in and tweak it, but I’m mixing all day every day. I want to know what each box sounds like. I want to turn it on and off and say ‘does this benefit?’. If the answer is no, we move on."

I look at it like filters on a picture. You’ve already taken the picture, but afterwards you might like it better with a filter on. A lot of people think that this is not the right way to work, and that you should mix through the converters and stay in one specific box. I disagree."

                                                orking out of Tarquin Studios in upstate New York, Peter Katis has an extensive collection of spectacular outboard gear. Because he has the tools available, he takes the opportunity to use them, running all of his buses through individual outboard compressors for a little extra glue and color. Occasionally, he also likes to run the mix through a ½ inch Studer tape machine.

                                                Katis sums all of his groups through the Thermionic Culture Fat Bustard II, which is an all-valve passive input summing mixer. The unit is less transparent than some of the other summing mixers discussed here, and it adds a healthy amount of heat to the program material. The unit also offers additional controls for stereo widening and harmonic ‘attitude’, as well as two unique ‘varislope’ EQ controls to boost the top and bottom end.

For years it was something that he wanted to explore, but he had to wait for the right time to make the jump. The opportunity arrived in 2016, shortly after completing work on Justin Bieber’s Purpose album.</p>

Upon taking a deeper dive into his workflow and philosophy, it becomes clear why.</p>

                                                Dangerous Music’s products are designed to be extremely transparent and musical, with a strong emphasis on ergonomic design. Kinelski likes to work in a similar way. He honors the musical choices made by his clients, and he always ensures that their unique traits shine through in an authentic way. His nuanced approach to processing helps him to achieve results that sound both natural and modern, making them stand out from the crowd. His hybrid mixing chain offers him headroom, control and quality.

It is subtle but there is a depth that is added. Digital is incredible too; you can stay in the box and it will sound amazing. But there is something about the depth and color that I get from analog that feels different to me. It feels a little more musical, and a little more interesting.

His set up is built around the RS216 Folcrom Passive Mixer by Roll Audio. The device offers a balanced, symmetrical signal path, using no amplifiers, ICs, transistors, capacitors or transformers. The absence of any trim or pan pots further ensures that the mixer has absolutely no impact on the balance, tone or stereo image of the program material. It is a truly transparent solution for analogue summing. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                The Folcrom mixer was designed for engineers who have racks full of incredible preamps that often lie dormant during the mixing process. By using the Folcrom, one is able to put them to use, imparting the tone of each independent preamp whilst simultaneously bringing the mix together in the purest way possible. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Maserati uses it for exactly this reason. He likes to send drums and bass through his vintage Neve console and vocals and guitars into a Chandler Mini Mixer, adding spades of harmonic energy and punch. These rich textures all sum together inside the Folcrom, but it doesn’t end there. Because the passive circuit has a relatively low output, it typically requires around 30-40dB of make-up gain. Maserati sees this as an opportunity to add even more character to his mixes, sending the stereo mix through a pair of classic V76 preamps. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                The warmth and density added by Maserati’s chain is hard to miss. These tones and textures are what make his mixes so recognisable, whilst also offering him an opportunity to use some of the inspiring gear that he has picked up over the course of his career.
